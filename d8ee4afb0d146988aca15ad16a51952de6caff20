      "message": "Using the modification time (instead of creation time) seems to me much more suitable, because if a picture becomes modified (cropped, color change etc.), then it is something different than before, which should be refelcted by the new sort order. And if the modification yields to a new file, then even the creation date would not keept the position of the new file.\n\nAnd most important: Reorganisation of pictures (folder structure, moving from internal SD card to external SD card etc.) keeps the sort order.\n\nAnother aspect is: A modification timestamp can be changed by many utilities, if it seems necessary (e.g. changing the file comments should not result in a modified sort order).\nBut the creation date (e.g. after moving to another file system) cannot be changed easily (afaik).",
